/*
	Dynamic memory allocation is the process of allocating memory at the runtime of a program.
	This memory is allocated in the heap of the program instead of stack memory.
	It is useful when:
	=> You are not sure about the size of the array you need
	=> Implementing data structures such as linked lists, trees etc
	=> In complex programs that requires efficient memory management

	- The new operator
	  The new operator is used to allocate memory dynamically. It returns a pointer
	  to the allocated memory.
	  Syntax:
		pointer = new data_type;	// For a single variable
		pointer = new data_type;	// For array
	- The delete operator
	  The delete operator is used to deallocate memory that was previously used by new
	  Syntax:
		delete pointer;      // For single object
		delete[] pointer;    // For arrays of object

	- Memory is a situation where memory allocated for a particular task remains allocated even
	  after it is no longer needed. Morever, if the address to the memory is lost, then it will
	  remain allocated till the program runs. Hence use delete appropriately and use smart pointers
	  whenever possible

	- Dangling pointers are created when memory pointed by the pointer is accessed after it is
	  deallocated leading to undefined behaviour like crashes, garbage. Hence initialise pointer with
	  nullptr and assign nullptr again after dealloacted
